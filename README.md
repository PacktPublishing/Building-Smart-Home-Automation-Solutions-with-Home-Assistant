**Configure, integrate, and manage hardware and software systems to automate your home**

## What is this book about?
Picture a home where you can adjust the lighting based on the time of day or when movement is detected. In this same home, you can also detect when a door is unexpectedly opened or an alarm is triggered in response to any suspicious activity. Such automated devices form part of a smart home, and the exciting part is that this book teaches you how to create and manage these devices all by yourself.
This book helps you create your own ecosystem to automate your home using Home Assistant software. You’ll begin by understanding the components of a home automation system and learn how to create, hack, and configure them to operate seamlessly. Then, you'll set up Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi to work as a home automation server, build your own IoT sensors based on ESP32/ESP8266, and set up real-life automation use cases using hands-on examples and projects.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand the fundamental concepts of home automation systems
* Set up a home automation system using Home Assistant and Raspberry Pi
* Create and configure ESP8266-based sensors to work with Home Assistant
* Hack a commercial actuator to work with Home Assistant using Tasmota
* Create automations, customize, and use applications with Home Assistant
* Leverage IoT software tools to take your home automation to the next level
